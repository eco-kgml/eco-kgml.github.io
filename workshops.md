# Eco-KGML Workshop

### [Home](eco-kgml.github.io) - [Project Goals](https://eco-kgml.github.io/projectgoals) - [Workshops](https://eco-kgml.github.io/workshops) - [The Team](https://eco-kgml.github.io/team) - [Documents](https://eco-kgml.github.io/documents)

The Eco-KGML team is dedicated to sharing their knowledge of how ecological and computer sciences can leverage each other for the benefit of the scientific community. Conducting workshops to introduce ecologists to KGML concepts and practices are a major part of that mission. 
Below, you will find links to our workshop materials to introduce you to the major concepts behind KGML.
