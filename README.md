Predicting how the environment is going to change is vital for making decisions about how to best manage our natural resources. Existing methods of making predictions about water quality are limited in their scope, but advances in data and computer science give us an opportunity to make greater and better-informed forecasts. The Eco-KGML group (Ecology Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning) is dedicated to researching the use of machine learning as a means of fine-tuning predictions of water quality that are driven by ecological knowledge. This will allow us to make predictions about water quality on a continental scale. For more information, check out the links above!
